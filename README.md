Cybersecurity KST Project

While the NIST 800-181r1 provides a great framework, it does so for the government sector.  The job roles do not clearly line up to a majority of the commercial industry.
The goal of this publication is to describe a framework for commercial cybersecurity work.  It describes the work as sets of Tasks and people needing to be able to perform a set list of Tasks that are aligned to a Job Role.  To perform these Tasks, those people need to have a set of Knowledge and Skills.
This will help students to develop skills and gain knowledge to be able to move into roles in the cybersecurity sector, and will allow employers to better tailor their job postings to requirements that are standard.  This is a framework, first and foremost. It is designed to provide guidance and improve communication about how to identify, develop, and retain cybersecurity talent.  Also note that many of the definitions and outlining is taken directly from the NIST 800-181r1.


Definitions:

Knowledge: A retreivable set of concepts within memory.
- Describes foundational or specific knowledge.
- Multiple statements may be needed to complete a task.
- A single statement may be used to complete many tasks.

Skill: The capacity to perform an observable action.
- Describes straightforward or complex skills.
- Multiple Skill statements may be needed to complete a Task.
- A single Skill statement may be used to complete more than one Task.

Task: An activity that is directed toward the achievement of organizational objectives. Must be: 
- Easy to read and understand
- Begin with the activity being executed.

Work Role:  A civilian job role within cybersecurity (note: at this time, do not list Junior, Senior, Principal, etc. as separate job titles.)

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:
Each category (Work Role, Knowledge, Skill, and Task) has its own tab on the spreadsheet.  While a Work Role may be a Penetration Tester, and a sample task may be "Perform technical vulnerability assessment of computer systems" and knowledge and skills that contribute to that may be K: Have an understanding of ports and services, K: Have an understanding of how nmap functions, and S: Skill in conducting network vulnerability scans, among others, you would add the corresponding Work Role, Knowledge, Tasks, and Skills to the appropriate tabs on the spreadsheet.  If this is a new Work Role, then make a new tab for it, and a new column for the Role on the Knowledge, Skill, and Tasks tab, with an 'x' in each row/column match. Additionally, be sure to add your name to this document. Also, be source to add where your source came from.
